# Logic Flow

Logic Flow is a developing web application that translates text notes into mindmap charts. It provides an unique UI for users to efficiently build a mindmap while typing notes from other sources such as websites, recording, lectures... 

Logic Flow adopts Quill.js editor and Konva.js to support customized wysiwyg text editor and JavaScript canvas library. I am currently working on designing state manegment system for the app's UI.

To ensure Logic Flow rendering performantly while sharing a potentially large amount of data across React components, Logic Flow adopts Recoil.js for the app's state management. For website styling, Logic Flow adopts :nail_care: Sytled-Components for performant, React component based styling library.
